# Operating-Systems
This repository has been opened to learn UNIX commands and understand basic operating system concepts. It includes the projects given in the operating systems laboratory course.
## Project 1 - UNIX and C Programming
### Procedure:
  A study path folder is created with the student number (Ex: Desktop/152120151028/). All operations are performed inside this folder via the terminal.
### Step 1
  Write the source code (Ex: 152120151028_uyg1C.<language>) that lists the largest prime numbers less than the number received from the user and the smallest prime numbers greater than the same number.
  ### Step 2
  Write a .sh script that automates the operations in the sub-steps (Ex: 152120151028_uyg1C.sh). Except for the repeated steps, each of the operations in the sub-steps must be performed with a single-line terminal command.
  #### Step 2.1
  If it doesn't exist, create a folder named tempFiles. If there is a folder with the same name, the relevant command must be created in such a way that it does not cause an error or warning!
  #### Step 2.2
  All content in the artifact is listed along with the artifact path, subfolder contents, and (for this step only) dimensions. This step is repeated right after all the sub-steps until the code compilation sub-step.
  #### Step 2.3
  <language> and all files with .sh extension are moved to tempFiles folder.
  #### Step 2.4
  All files in the working path (all content except folder) are deleted.
  #### Step 2.5
  All content in the 2.5.tempFiles folder is copied to the work path.
  #### Step 2.6
  The 2.6.tempFiles folder (with its contents) is deleted.
  #### Step 2.7
  Written source code is compiled.
  #### Step 2.8
  The compiled file is run so that the output produced by the program (Ex: 152120151028_uyg1C_output.txt) is directed to the file, and the number of characters in the output file is printed on the screen immediately after each redirect. output file should be.
  #### Step 2.9
